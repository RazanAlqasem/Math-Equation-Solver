Math Equation Solver (Java + Linked List + GUI)

The project is a Java-based equation solver specifically designed to handle polynomial expressions.
Rather than using built-in data structures like ArrayList or Map, I chose to implement the logic using a custom linked list to represent each polynomial as a series of nodes.


The graphical user interface (GUI) was designed using Java Swing and allows users to:

- Email Verification:
 Users must enter a valid email address to access the calculator. If the email is invalid, they are prompted to re-enter it until it's correct.

- Calculator interface:
$ Enter two polynomial equations.

$ Specify an operation (addition, subtraction,         multiplication, or long division).

$ Enter a value for "x" (to evaluate the equation).

$ Support printing the polynomial expressions in multiple notations:
    - Infix 
    - Prefix
    - Postfix
$ Find and display the roots of the polynomial equations.

$ Option to delete or reset specific inputs if needed.

## Usage

Run the main class (like Mathh or your main GUI class).

When the app starts, enter a valid email to access the calculator.

In the calculator interface:

Enter two polynomial equations.

Choose the operation you want (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

Enter a value for x if you want to evaluate the equation.

You can display the equations in different formats: infix, prefix, or postfix.

See the roots of the polynomial if available.
- Example:
Enter: 3x^2 + 2x - 5

Enter: x^2 - x + 1

Operation: Multiplication

x = 2

infix
